\line \line                      On this page, ASIC publishes its allocation of equity market products to the pre-trade transparency block trade tiers. \line  ASIC will determine, on a quarterly basis, the equity market products allocated to the block trade tiers and publish them on this webpage. \line  Background and procedure \line  Rule 6.1.1 of the ASIC Market Integrity Rules (Securities Markets) 2017 requires that market participants must not enter into a transaction for an equity market product or CGS depository interest unless the transaction is entered into by matching of a pre-trade transparent order on an order book. \line  Rule 6.1.2 (Securities Markets) requires a market operator to make available pre-trade information. \line  There are a number of exceptions to these rules, including Rule 6.2.1 (Securities Markets). This exception allows a transaction to be executed without pre-trade transparency where the consideration for the transaction is not less than: \line  \line  $1 million or more for Tier 1 equity market products; \line  $500,000 or more for Tier 2 equity market products; and \line  $200,000 or more for Tier 3 equity market products and CGS depository interests. \line  \line  As required by Rule 6.2.1 (Securities Markets), ASIC will determine the tier 1 equity market products and tier 2 equity market products and register the determination on the Federal Register of Legislation ( www.legislation.gov.au ). ASIC will perform this calculation quarterly and the determination will be registered in the week commencing on the first Monday of each March, June, September and December. The determination will take effect on the 20th business day after the Friday following the first Monday of each March, June, September and December. If the Friday is a public holiday, the determination will be registered on the next business day. In calculating the 20 business days, the day of registration, Saturdays, Sundays, New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day are not included. ASIC will also publish the equity market products that fall within each tier on this page.  \line  We will publish a CSV file with the equity market products determined to be tier 1 equity market products and tier 2 equity market products, including the stock code and company name. \line  Equity market products not listed in the CSV file are tier 3 equity market products. \line  The file will be saved with the naming convention: mir-sm-621-block-trade-tiers-yyyymmdd.csv. \line  Changes to tier 1 equity market products and tier 2 equity market products will be published in a separate CSV file. This file will be saved with the following naming convention: mir-sm-621-block-trade-tiers-yyyymmdd-changes-from-previous-quarter.csv. \line  New products and tier changes during a period (e.g. listings, corporate actions, product code change) \line  \line  A new equity market product (e.g. resulting from a company listing or a corporate action) will be considered a tier 3 equity market product until the next quarterly ADV calculation where it may be determined to be tier 1 equity market product or tier 2 equity market product. Where a product has changed its name or code only, the industry should treat the equity market product’s block trade tier as unchanged until the next quarterly ADV calculation and determination comes into effect. \line  In exceptional circumstances where there is a new equity listing or corporate action that is so significant that S&P adds it to the S&P/ASX 200 during a period, ASIC will determine that it be a tier 1 equity market product. If possible, ASIC will replace the following block tier CSV files prior to the date of the scheduled listing or corporate action, and issue a special notification on our website to inform the industry of the new files. \line  \line  Download files \line  Published 7 March 2024, effective 9 April 2024 \line  Download Products allocated to   tiers 1 and 2 (CSV 4 KB) \line  Download Changes from previous publication (CSV 2 KB) \line \line                     \line                  \line              \line          \line      \line      \line      \line          \line             \line                                   \line                              \line                                              \line                                                  Report suspicious activity \line                                              \line \line                              \line                          \line                              \line  If you are a market participant and you see or suspect market misconduct you must notify ASIC \line  Lodge a suspicious activity report \line                              \line                          \line                      \line                      \line                              \line                                              \line                                                  Subscribe for updates \line                                              \line \line                              \line                          \line                              \line  For the latest regulatory developments and issues affecting market intermediaries  subscribe to our monthly Market Integrity Update. \line                              \line                          \line                      \line                      \line                              \line                                              \line                                                  What's new \line                                              \line \line                              \line                         \line                          \line                              \line  27 March 2024 - MEDIA RELEASE 24-059MR Cameron Waugh sentenced to two years imprisonment for insider trading Former corporate adviser Cameron Kerr Waugh has been sentenced to two years imprisonment from 25 March 2024, with release after nine months, upon ... \line  18 March 2024 - NEWS ITEM ASIC issues new legislative instrument for exchange traded funds ASIC has released a new legislative instrument ASIC Corporations (Relief to Facilitate Admission of Exchange Traded Funds) Instrument 2024/147.
